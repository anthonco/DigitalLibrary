# Digital Library JavaScript Class

Created by Corey Anthony

## Points for discussion during code review:



## UI Classes:

UI super classes that prototype Library

```
ShowAuthorsUI
AddBooksUI
```

## Other:

```
_getLibState is called from ShowAuthorsUI to load the books from local storage.
Util.js instantiates the _bookShelf arrau.
```
